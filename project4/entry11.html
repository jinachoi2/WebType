            Map of Soul album was released early this year by the globally famous Kpop group, BTS. Honestly, there is too much to talk about regarding this group so I won't go into much detail. But I wanted to share this song because my little sister is a fan. You can hear some ramblings about BTS by her.

            This post is a continuation of <a href="entry10.html"><b>Entry 10: Volleyball 1</b></a> but will focus a bit on my sister, Yenna, as well because I would'nt have been able to enjoy playing volleyball during the covid-19 outbreak and watching Haikyuu!!. I am lucky to have someone who loves playing the same sport even thought I have no access to a court or team. Volleyball would be so boring if played by only person. This is us a few days ago trying to keep a rally of 20 after a few years hiatus.

            So, yesterday my sister and I went outside to play volleyball. We would usually play indoors and just pass to each other but today we felt like spiking and setting higher. I played a setter back in high school and my sister plays spiker. Too bad the weather was too windy though.... Anyway we were sooo out of practice (it's been a few years since I've been on court!).

            It was also fun to watch a few episodes the newly released season of Haikyu!! together and have the opportunity to talk about together. Maybe it's because I have a few friends deeply rooted in the animation field (animation/illustration students and those already in the profession) or long-time fans of the show (like my sister) discussing the changes in art, flow and narration of the new season was interesting and insightful.

          <p class="paragraph-container entry5-color">
            Quick review: I think the previous seasons had more energy and flow in storytelling and conveying emotion compared to the new season. But I also think the story is a little slow right now because it's building up for the finale in the next season. My sister liked the art style of this season and a friend of my agreed that motion and animation aspect was a bit lacking. Overall the story focused more on the introspection, self-reflection and growth within the main cast before entering the national tournament. Hopefully we'll be able to see more action in the next season that is coming out this summer (unless it's delayed because of covid-19!).
