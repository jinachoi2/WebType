            Palette was released in 2017 and is the fourth studio album by the singer-songwriter IU. Not only is the song sung by a popular single female Korean singer, but it also features globally acclaimed G-Dragon from Big Bang. IU's prominent theme in her works is about her presonal growth and maturing as both an artist and an individual. Unlike her previous albums, Palette convyes the ideas of adulthood, identity and individuality. IU expresses her newfound validation of her identity through honest lyrics that allude to her past performances.

            I wanted to introduce this song since it was the song I heard the most while I spent my morning outside of the house today. I went to the dentist’s for a checkup and met up with my sister and mom for lunch afterwards.

            Coming back home also means a general health checkup since I come back every half or full year. I came back earlier than usual due to the outbreak so I went to the dentist. The dentist’s is a place I doubt anyone really likes, and I am no exception. While I am not particularly scared of sharp silver metal gadgets poking into my mouth, opening my mouth for long periods of time is exhausting and uncomfortable. I feel a bit vulnerable and need to concentrate hard just to keep my mouth wide open (Oh my, the sides of my mouth are starting to hurt just writing about this!). Anyway, because my eyes are always closed, I have no idea what the dentist is doing. All I hear is the whirring of the tools jabbing into my mouth.

            After that uncomfortable experience, I met up with my sister and mom at a noodle and dumpling restaurant right next to our home. It was a fun meal despite the lack of people because we were so fixed on the playlist the owner decided to play. Only IU’s songs were played. It was just a funny situation because we joked that the owner was an IU fan playing his favorite tunes, while his customer, aka. my mom, is an anti or anti-fan.

            Rather than long hair, I definitely prefer a short bob<br>
            Nonetheless, I was still pretty when I sang Good Day<br>
            Why is it that I like things that are a bit tacky?<br>
            Rather than pictures, I prefer filled palettes, diaries, times I was asleep<br>

            Anyway, we came out, walked for a bit and finally went to the macaron store for my sister. As soon as we walked in, the IU’s Palette came on again.
