            BURNOUT SYNDROMES is a Japanese three-person rock band that formed in 2005. They picked up fame and recognition after singing the openings (Fly High!!, Hikari Are, Phoneix) of a Japanese animated series called Haikyuu!!. I first heard of the band when I saw my sister watching the series years ago.

            I wanted to introduce this song because my sister and I had a full day (well, maybe half since we both had work to do!) dedicated to volleyball today: we watched clips of one of the world’s top volleyball athletes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Yeon-koung" target="_blank"><b>Kim Yeong Koung,</b></a> rewatched a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikyu!!" target="_blank"><b>Haikyuu!!</b></a> and played the sport outside.

          <p class="paragraph-container entry10-color">
            So, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kimyk10/?hl=en" target="_blank"><b>Kim Yeong Koung</b></a> is a South Korean professional volleyball player who not only is a super talented and powerful athlete, but also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjaZxgFdN5I" target="_blank"><b>cool and refreshing celebrity</b></a> in Korea’s entertainment world. Kim played for various teams: a spiker and the captain of the <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea_women%27s_national_volleyball_team#Current_roster" target="_blank"><b>South Korean National Team,</b></a> MVP and one of the Best 6 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JT_Marvelous" target="_blank"><b>Japan,</b></a> the Best Foreign Player in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Volleyball_Super_League"><b>China</b></a> and finally, Best Scorer, MVP, and captain in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenerbah%C3%A7e_Women%27s_Volleyball" target="_blank"><b>Turkey.</b></a> Once a shy volleyball player myself, I am always amazed at Kim’s talents and enjoy watching her plays.

            Anyway, I came across a reaction video about Haikyuu!! by Kim herself. Did I mention that she has her own YouTube channel? Fun fact: her channel name is pronounced SikBbang Unnie, which translates to sandwich bread older sister, because SikBbang sounds like the swear word Kim says a lot.

            Anywayyy, I came across her reaction video and was delightfully amused at how a professional would view a fictional tv show. I was happy to know that her thoughts about the show were similar to mine, since I was also surprised when the sports aspect of the series was pretty realistic in terms of rules, details and even some of the emotions felt by a player. I think this would be a good time to explain a little bit about Haikyuu!!... So as I’ve hinted before, the series revolves around the sports, volleyball. The story mainly follows Hinata, a short middle school student who found a passion for volleyball after watching the “Little Giant” in the national championship tournament on TV. He later enrolls into the same high school as the Little Giant in order to become a great athlete despite his short height along with his new team members.

            I think I will stop here for today, since I think I will need room for another entry to finish talking about my sister’s and my volleyball special day…! I just wanted to share how I continued my love for volleyball despite losing friends and courts to play a full set with. I will continue in the next entry!
