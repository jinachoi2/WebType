          <p>Welcome to the <i>Virtual Playlist</i>. This personal collection is a deep record shelf where you can explore various music and Jinaâ€™s thoughts and experiences that tie into each tune. It may be the lyrics, the melody or even the point of time the song existed in that prompted each journal entry. They may entirely consist of subjective emotions and ramblings or pull from different bits and pieces of articles or videos that sparked any interest. Each episode focuses on the relationship between sound and type as a way to express ideas into the virtual world many live in today. Ultimately, this intangible shelf is an outlet created to help ride the waves of change the covid-19 outbreak currently brings.</p>
